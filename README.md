**`ï£¿ Apple Platform Developer`**

I am a passionate self-taught iOS developer with a deep love for crafting intuitive and engaging applications for Apple platforms. With hands-on experience in Swift and SwiftUI, I have successfully published the app, [SetEvents](https://apple.co/4d930mo) on the App Store. I pride myself on writing clean, efficient code and managing projects through command-line Git and GitHub, ensuring smooth version control and collaboration. As a member of the Apple Developer Program, I actively engage in bug discovery and reporting, contributing to improving the ecosystem I care about. My focus is on turning ideas into reality, creating sleek user interfaces, and optimizing app performance while continuously learning and growing as a developer.

> [!NOTE]
> Oh, and if you're into the whole academic thing: I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CGPA 3.97/4.00), and I even got to spend a semester in South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· as an exchange student on Korean Government Scholarship. Not too shabby, right?
